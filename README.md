Project Overview

The Sweet Shop Management System is a full-stack web application designed to manage sweets inventory for a shop.
It supports user registration, login, role-based access (User/Admin), and secure inventory operations.

My AI Usage

During the development of this project, I used AI tools as a learning and assistance resource to better understand concepts and debug issues effectively.

AI Tools Used

ChatGPT (OpenAI)
I used ChatGPT to:

Understand backend concepts such as JWT authentication, password hashing with bcrypt, and role-based authorization.

Design and structure RESTful API endpoints.

Debug frontend and backend issues related to API failures, authentication errors, and React rendering.

Improve Git and GitHub workflow, including repository setup, commits, .gitignore usage, and pushing code.

Improve UI logic, conditional rendering, and overall application flow.

Write clear and structured documentation for the project.
